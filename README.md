# [Sergei Kolobov](https://github.com/skolobov) dotfiles

These configuration files are meant to be cross-platform as much as possible.
I am using them under the following operating systems:

* [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/)
* [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org)
* [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com)

My primary machine is currently a MacBook Pro running macOS 10.12 Sierra.

## Components

These configuration files are for the following systems:

* [Fish Shell](http://fishshell.com)
* [Neovim](http://neovim.io)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com)

All of these things are available via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) on macOS, and
native package managers on FreeBSD and Ubuntu.

## Fish

I was a long-time [Zsh](http://zsh.org) user, but switched to Fish shell some time ago.

Check out [Awesome Fish](https://github.com/jbucaran/awesome-fish) for
excellent curated list of awesome tools, prompts and other cool nuggets for the
amazing Fish shell.

## Neovim

Sensible defaults for all the things!
Check out [my Neovim config] (neovim/init.vim) for more info.
It is pretty well documented.

Vim plugins are managed with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug),
so on first run in nvim you will need to do a `:PlugInstall`.


## Fonts

If you want to take full advantage of
[airline.vim](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline) you'll want to install and
use one of the [Powerline fonts](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts).
I recommend either `Meslo` or `Deja Vu Sans Mono`.
