# [Sergei Kolobov][] dotfiles

These configuration files are meant to be cross-platform as much as possible.
I am using them under the following operating systems:

* [macOS][]
* [FreeBSD][]
* [Ubuntu][]

My primary machine is currently a MacBook Pro running macOS 10.12 Sierra.

## Components

These configuration files are for the following systems:

* [Fish][] shell
* [Neovim][] editor
* [Git][] DVCS

All of these things are available via [Homebrew][] on [macOS][], and native
package managers on [FreeBSD][] and [Ubuntu][].

## Fish

I was previously a long-time [Zsh][] user, but switched to [Fish][] shell
some time ago and enjoying it very much - [Fish][] has become my favorite
shell.

Check out [Awesome Fish][] for excellent curated list of awesome tools,
prompts and other cool nuggets for the amazing Fish shell.

Additionally, [Fish shell cookbook][] contains a lot of tips and recipes for
[Fish][].

## Neovim

Sensible defaults for all the things! Check out my [Neovim config][] for more
info. It is pretty well documented.

Vim plugins are managed with [vim-plug][], so on first run in [Neovim][] you
will need to do a `:PlugInstall`.


## Fonts

If you want to take full advantage of [airline.vim][] you'll want to install
and use one of the [Powerline fonts][]. I recommend using [Nerd Fonts][].
